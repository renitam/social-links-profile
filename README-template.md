## My process

- I started off with a desktop version, then added margin properties and max-width values for screen responsiveness. Nothing major since the screen is so small. I used variables in the style.css file for the design system, but didn't use BEM methodology since the html file was so small.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Github pages

### What I learned

When I started this project, it'd been a year or two since I'd done anything web development related period. I had to relearn things like how css stylings work, html tags and ordering, and things like that. Like I forgot that commas in css classes act like or operators, and I needed to use spaces for "and" operators instead. Github pages is way easier to use than I remembered from last time... just the flick of a switch in my repository.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I plan on adding a custom cursor for button hovers, and updating the design for accessibility.
